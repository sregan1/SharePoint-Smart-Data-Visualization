## Features

### Simple by Default, Advanced on Demand

The web part starts in **simple mode** — one property pane page and a streamlined editor. Flip **Show Advanced Options** in the property pane to unlock additional pages for appearance tuning, analytics, and interactivity. Advanced features that are already configured keep working even when the toggle is off, so simplifying the UI never breaks a published chart. All 15 chart types are available in both modes.

### Data Sources

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| **Upload File** | Upload a CSV, TSV, or Excel (.xlsx / .xls) file directly from your computer. Data persists across page reloads (up to 200 KB). Multi-sheet workbooks get a sheet picker. |
| **SharePoint List** | Load data from any SharePoint list on the current or another site (up to 5,000 items, with a warning when truncated) |
| **SharePoint File** | Reference a CSV or Excel file stored in a SharePoint document library by URL |
| **REST API** | Connect to any REST endpoint that returns JSON, with optional response caching |
| **Microsoft Graph** | Chart any Graph endpoint (e.g. `/me/memberOf`) — requires admin-approved permissions |

### Chart Types

![Gallery showing chart types](screenshots/chart-gallery.png)

| Chart | Best Used For |
|---|---|
| **Bar (Vertical)** | Comparing values across categories |
| **Bar (Horizontal)** | Same as vertical; better for long category names |
| **Line** | Trends over time |
| **Area** | Trends over time with emphasis on volume |
| **Scatter** | Correlation between two numeric variables |
| **Bubble** | Correlation between two numeric variables with a third size dimension |
| **Pie** | Part-to-whole relationships (up to ~7 categories) |
| **Doughnut** | Same as pie with a center hole for labels or KPIs |
| **Radar** | Multi-attribute comparison across several items |
| **KPI Tile** | A single aggregated number with threshold coloring — dashboard headlines |
| **Histogram** | Distribution of a numeric column, with configurable bins |
| **Waterfall** | Cumulative gains and losses (e.g. monthly P&L) |
| **Box Plot** | Value distribution and outliers per category |
| **Treemap** | Proportions as nested area tiles |
| **Heatmap** | Intensity across two category dimensions |

### Data Shaping & Analytics

- **Group-by aggregation** — Sum, Average, Count, Min, or Max per category, applied before charting
- **Sort, filter, and row limit** — shape the data inline without touching the source
- **Trendlines & forecast** — linear regression or moving average overlays; project the trend up to 12 periods ahead
- **Reference lines** — fixed value, mean, or median drawn as a dashed line
- **Date/time X axis** — date columns are auto-detected and plotted on a true time scale
- **Conditional formatting** — highlight values above or below a threshold in a custom color
- **Combo charts** — mix bars and lines per series on the same chart

### Interactivity

![Drill-down with breadcrumb navigation](screenshots/feature-drilldown.png)

- **Viewer filters** — opt-in filter bar so page visitors can slice the data themselves
- **Details on demand** — click a bar or slice to see the underlying rows
- **Drill-down** — define a column hierarchy (e.g. Region → Country → City) and click to drill, with breadcrumb navigation
- **Bookmarks** — save named view states; viewers pick them from a dropdown
- **Dynamic Data** — chart clicks publish the selected category/value/series to connected web parts
- **Custom tooltips** — append extra columns from the hovered row
- **Auto-refresh & caching** — reload network sources on an interval, cache API responses per session

### Other Features

- **Web part header** — optional title above the chart, toggled from the property pane
- **7 color palettes** — Office, Vibrant, Pastel, Monochrome, Traffic Light, Warm, Cool — plus per-series color overrides and color-by-category for scatter/bubble
- **Data labels** — optional value annotations with prefix/suffix and K/M abbreviation
- **Stacked bars** — toggle stacking on Bar and Line charts
- **Data table** — optional tabular view below the chart, paginated
- **Export** — download as PNG, JPEG, CSV (UTF-8 with BOM, Excel-safe), or Excel from every chart
- **Dark theme support** — chart colors adapt to dark section backgrounds
- **Localized & accessible** — all UI strings localizable; screen-reader-friendly charts and forms

## Configuration

All settings are managed through the web part property pane (click the pencil icon while the page is in Edit mode). Data source selection, column mapping, data controls, and the Advanced Options panel live **inline in the web part** while editing, because they depend on the loaded data.

By default the pane shows a single page of essentials. Turning on **Show Advanced Options** (bottom of the first page) expands it to three pages — **Chart**, **Appearance**, and **Advanced** — and reveals the additional inline panels.

### Page 1 — Chart

**Header**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Show Header** | On | Display a prominent title above the chart |
| **Header Text** | _(blank)_ | The title text shown in the header |

## Graph API Permissions

The package does **not** declare any Microsoft Graph permissions, so there is **no admin trust dialog** during deployment. The other four data sources (Upload File, SharePoint List, SharePoint File, REST API) and every chart feature work with no Graph permissions at all.

To use the **Microsoft Graph** data source, a tenant admin must grant the required scope(s) manually:

**Option A — Manual grant (no redeployment needed):**
1. Open **SharePoint Admin Center** → **Advanced** → **API access**.
2. Click **Manage** (or **+ Add a request**) and add a permission for the `SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal`.
3. Grant `User.Read` as a baseline. Add any additional scopes your Graph endpoints need (e.g. `Reports.Read.All`, `Group.Read.All`).

**Option B — Restore the package declaration (restores the standard trust-dialog flow):**
Add the following to `config/package-solution.json` under `"solution"` and redeploy:
```json
"webApiPermissionRequests": [
  { "resource": "Microsoft Graph", "scope": "User.Read" }
]
```
SharePoint will then prompt for admin approval during the next deployment, after which the permission is pre-approved for all Graph calls.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Scatter and bubble charts need numeric values…"** — the mapped X or Y column contains no numbers. Pick a numeric column in the Column Mapping panel.
- **Microsoft Graph source returns 401/403** — the Graph permission request has not been approved, or your endpoint needs a scope not listed in `package-solution.json`. See [Graph API Permissions](#graph-api-permissions).
- **"This list has 5,000 or more items…"** — SharePoint returns at most 5,000 items per request. Filter the list with a view-backed approach or aggregate the data upstream.
- **Arrows or accented characters look garbled in an exported CSV** — fixed in 2.0; exports now include a UTF-8 BOM. Re-export with the current version.
- **Advanced settings disappeared** — the **Show Advanced Options** toggle (bottom of property pane page 1) is off. Configured behavior keeps working; only the configuration UI hides.

---

## Limitations

- **Upload file data size:** Uploaded file data is serialized to the web part property bag. Datasets up to 200 KB persist across page reloads. Larger files display for the current session only — store them in a SharePoint document library and use the SharePoint File source for fully persistent large datasets.
- **SharePoint list size:** A maximum of 5,000 items is loaded per list (SharePoint REST limit); a warning is shown when this cap is hit.
- **Microsoft Graph:** Requires tenant-admin approval of Graph permissions; without approval the Graph source cannot load data.
- **Direct database connections:** SPFx cannot connect directly to databases. Use a REST API (e.g., Azure Function or custom API) that queries your database and returns JSON.
- **Cross-origin REST APIs:** The browser's same-origin policy applies. For external APIs, ensure CORS headers are configured on the server.
- **Forecast:** Trendline forecasting extends category axes only (not the time axis).
